# Interview questions 

## Walking through a problem
- Pay attention to details of the question to help create an efficient algorithm
- Debug your example, is it a special case? Is it big enough?
- Start with brute force first, don't code yet. State a naive algorithm and its runtime then optimize from there
- Optimize using BUD (Bottleneck, Unecessary work, Duplicated work)
	- Look for any unused info about the problem
	- Solve it manually then revert engineer the thought process, how did you do it?
	- Solve it incorrectly and think about why it fails
	- Make time and space tradeoff, hash tables are very useful
